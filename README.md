# 🌦️ AutoAI Weather Prediction Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use IBM Watsonx AutoAI to train machine learning models for weather condition prediction based on historical weather data.

This notebook leverages Python 3.11 and the ibm-watsonx-ai package to automate the machine learning process — from data loading to model training and evaluation.

The dataset contains 12 columns of hourly weather data. The goal is to predict the:

Weather (Target variable): A categorical column indicating the observed weather condition (e.g., Clear, Cloudy, Rain, Snow).


🎯 Project Goals
The notebook is designed to:

✅ Load and explore weather data

✅ Define and run an AutoAI experiment

✅ Automatically train multiple ML models

✅ Compare model performance metrics

✅ Generate predictions for new weather input data

No manual feature engineering or model tuning required — AutoAI handles it for you.

📈 Example Use Case
Provide real-time weather input values (like temperature, humidity, and wind speed), and get predicted weather conditions such as:

☀️ Clear

🌧️ Rain

🌫️ Fog

❄️ Snow
